## Want to find all relevant documents?
HiCAL is a system for efficient high-recall retrieval. The system allows retrieving and assessing relevant documents with high data processing performance and a user-friendly document assessment interface.

To learn more about HiCAL, read our [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3209978.3210176) or visit the project's [website](https://hical.github.io/).
